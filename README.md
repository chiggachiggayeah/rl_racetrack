# Racetrack

This is an attempt at making a tool to visualize the performance of a Reinforcement Learning agent on the the Racetrack problem from Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. Currently, I'm designing the agent to use On-Policy and Off-Policy Monte Carlo methods, but in the future perhaps the agent could also use other methods.
